# HamilitonDataModellingProject

The objective of this project was to determine what variables were responsible for
Hamilton's housing prices in 2016. I took the Canadian census tracts from the 
official website, selected over 10 variables which could possibly affect the 
variation in the city's housing costs. Taking those variables, normalizing the 
data, fitting them in the correlation matrix to help us determine which variables
have a positive correlation with the housing costs.

I then fit a linear regression on the variables, checking off all the 
assumptions of the linear regression model and determined that the 
Employment Rate, Educational Major, as well as Age/Sex to be major
variables that affects the housing costs in Hamilton.
